# ICN v2 â€” Planetary Mesh

A peer-to-peer overlay network for distributed computation and data availability.

- **Compute Overlay**: Nodes contribute resources and participate in executing CoVM tasks.
- **Data Availability**: Ensures DAG blocks and relevant state are replicated across the mesh.
- **Peer Discovery & Routing**: Mechanisms for nodes to find each other and route messages efficiently.
