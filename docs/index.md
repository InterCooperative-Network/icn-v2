## Understanding ICN's Core Layers

The InterCooperative Network is built upon a modular, three-layer architecture designed for verifiable governance and decentralized coordination:

1.  **ü™ô Wallet Layer**: The user's personal agent within the ICN. It manages Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and facilitates secure, offline-first interactions with federations. 
    *Learn more in the [Architecture Overview](architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md#21-wallet-layer).*

2.  **üó£Ô∏è Deliberation Layer (AgoraNet)**: Provides the infrastructure for structured, authenticated discussions and proposal development. This layer ensures that governance processes are transparent and participatory. (Note: AgoraNet is currently in design phase).
    *Learn more in the [Architecture Overview](architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md#22-deliberation-layer-agoranet).*

3.  **‚öôÔ∏è Runtime Layer (CoVM)**: The Cooperative Virtual Machine is a WASM-based execution environment. It runs compiled Contract Chain Language (CCL) modules, enforces governance logic, anchors outcomes to the federation DAG, and manages economic metering.
    *Learn more in the [Architecture Overview](architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md#23-runtime-layer-covm).*

These layers work in concert to provide a comprehensive platform for decentralized cooperation. Explore the [full Architecture Overview](architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) for more details.
