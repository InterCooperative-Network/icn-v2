# ICN v2

A clean-slate refactor of the InterCooperative Network's federated infrastructure, emphasizing modular design, verifiable governance, and decentralized coordination.

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular architecture organized within a Rust workspace:

```
crates/
â”œâ”€â”€ runtime/icn-runtime           # Core runtime logic
â”œâ”€â”€ wallet/icn-wallet             # Wallet management and transaction signing
â”œâ”€â”€ agoranet/agoranet-core        # Core networking and consensus protocols
â”œâ”€â”€ mesh/planetary-mesh           # Peer-to-peer mesh networking layer
â”œâ”€â”€ common/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icn-types                 # Common data types and structures
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ icn-identity-core       # Identity management and cryptographic primitives
â””â”€â”€ tools/icn-cli                 # Command-line interface for interacting with the network
```

## ðŸš§ Known Issues

- `ed25519_dalek::PublicKey` import fails during `cargo check`, even with correct dependency.
- Suspected IDE or toolchain cache issue. Reboot or `cargo clean` may not be sufficient.
- Proceeding with implementation assuming proper availability of the `PublicKey` type.
