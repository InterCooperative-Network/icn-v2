# 📘 InterCooperative Network (ICN) — Overview

## 1. Introduction

The **InterCooperative Network (ICN)** is a federated infrastructure stack designed to replace extractive governance and economic systems with **verifiable, cooperative, and regenerative alternatives**. Built from first principles, ICN empowers communities, cooperatives, and individuals to coordinate, govern, and thrive without reliance on centralized authorities.

At its core, ICN is not just a protocol or platform. It is a **new substrate for democratic infrastructure**: one grounded in **trust, purpose, and cryptographic coordination**.

## 2. Vision

ICN was created to serve as the **execution environment for the revolution**. It challenges the assumptions of capitalist software, redefines coordination through verifiable trust, and treats governance not as a product, but as a **living, auditable process**.

The system provides:

* **Forkless constitutional history** through append-only DAGs.
* **Scoped, identity-bound coordination** via decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
* **Portable, enforceable governance** using WASM-based contract execution.
* **A compute mesh commons**, enabling task distribution and resource exchange across devices.

The vision is clear: **a post-capitalist digital infrastructure for real-world cooperation.**

## 3. ICN System Stack

### 🧠 Identity Layer

* Ed25519 DIDs and W3C-compatible Verifiable Credentials.
* TrustBundles and quorum-signed mandates.
* Proof of governance via ExecutionReceipts.

### 🗳️ Governance Layer

* Append-only DAGs represent immutable constitutional timelines.
* CCL (Contract Chain Language) → WASM compilation for enforceable proposals.
* Anchored votes, amendments, and receipts with quorum proofs.

### 🧮 Economic Layer

* Scoped resource tokens (non-speculative).
* Metered execution and cooperative resource accounting.
* Credential-bound usage policies and mint/transfer logic.

### 🔗 Federation Layer

* Federation DAGs with genesis anchoring, merges, and splits.
* Replayable TrustBundles with canonical hashes.
* Key recovery, mandate rotation, and lineage preservation.

### 💬 Deliberation Layer (AgoraNet)

* Threaded proposals and deliberation.
* DID-authenticated messages with federation scoping.
* Integration with Wallet and Runtime execution flow.

### 📱 Wallet Layer

* Mobile-first agent for DIDs, credentials, and DAG proofs.
* Offline-first architecture with encrypted local cache.
* Task queueing, selective disclosure, and federation interaction.

### 🌐 Compute Mesh

* Identity-scoped distributed WASM execution.
* Peer-to-peer task sharing with verifiable receipts.
* Run across phones, laptops, routers, and other edge devices.

## 4. Key Components

* **ICN Runtime (CoVM):** The constitutional execution engine.
* **ICN Wallet:** Sovereign mobile agent for coordination and identity.
* **AgoraNet:** Deliberative interface for governance workflows.
* **Federation DAG:** Immutable memory of all constitutional events.
* **TrustBundles:** Canonical, signed records of proposals, votes, and anchors.
* **Planetary Mesh:** Decentralized task execution with credentialed trust.

---

## 5. How It Works

* **Federation Genesis:** Each federation bootstraps with a DID, quorum config, and genesis anchor.
* **Proposal Lifecycle:** Human-readable CCL → compiled WASM → executed in Runtime → anchored and credentialed.
* **Verifiable Coordination:** All actions are signed, anchored, and replayable.
* **Economic Enforcement:** Scoped tokens, usage metering, and enforceable policies.
* **Resilience & Recovery:** Mandate rotation, key updates, and cryptographic lineage tracking.

## 6. Use Cases

* Democratic worker cooperatives and mutual aid groups.
* Local and regional governance federations.
* Distributed research networks and compute collectives.
* Post-disaster coordination infrastructure.
* Replacing legal or institutional dependencies with verifiable trust.
