❄️ **Placeholder Crate – API in Design**

This crate is intended for the ICN deliberation layer (AgoraNet), facilitating proposals, discussions, and related governance workflows.

The API and implementation are currently in the design phase. This placeholder exists to reserve the structural location within the project for upcoming development.

Refer to project documentation and upcoming RFCs for more details on AgoraNet's design and integration.
