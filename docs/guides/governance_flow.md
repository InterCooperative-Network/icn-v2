# ICN v2 â€” Governance Flow

The lifecycle of a network proposal:

1.  **Proposal Creation**: A member crafts a proposal (e.g., code update, parameter change) and submits it via AgoraNet.
2.  **Deliberation**: Discussion and refinement occur within AgoraNet.
3.  **Voting**: Eligible members cast votes on the proposal using their Wallet agent. Votes are recorded on the DAG.
4.  **Tallying & Execution**: Votes are tallied; if passed, the proposal's execution logic is triggered within CoVM.
5.  **Receipt**: A cryptographic receipt confirming the outcome (pass/fail, execution results) is generated and anchored to the DAG.
