# ICN v2 — Architecture Overview

ICN (InterCooperative Network) is a **federated execution stack** built on:
1. **Runtime (CoVM)** — WASM executor, DAG anchoring
2. **Wallet** — DID key store, VC issuer/holder, DAG agent
3. **AgoraNet** — Deliberation & proposal staging
4. **Planetary Mesh** — P2P compute overlay

Key Principles: verifiable identity • execution‑centric governance • purpose‑bound economy • forkless DAG memory.
